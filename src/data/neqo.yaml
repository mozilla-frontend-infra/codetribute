  ## About Neqo

  Neqo is the QUIC implementation used by Mozilla in Firefox and other products.
  It is written in Rust and provides a library for QUIC transport, HTTP/3, and QPACK.
  The TLS security backend is the Mozilla NSS library, which is also used by Firefox.
  
  Neqo is designed to be used in Firefox, but it can also be used standalone.
  We include command line tools for testing and debugging, such as neqo-client
  and neqo-server, which can be used to test HTTP/3 servers and clients.
