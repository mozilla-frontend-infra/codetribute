  ## About Addons.mozilla.org (AMO)

  Addons.mozilla.org (AMO), is Mozilla's official site for discovering and
  installing add-ons for the Firefox browser. Add-ons help you modify and
  personalize your browsing experience by adding new features to Firefox,
  enhancing your interactions with Web content, and changing the way your
  browser looks.

  ## Get involved

  Mozilla is a non-profit champion of the Internet, we build Firefox to help
  keep it healthy, open and accessible. Add-ons support user choice and
  customization in Firefox, and you can contribute in the following ways:

  * [Make your own add-on]. We provide free hosting and update services and
    can help you reach a large audience of users.
  * Help improve this website. It's open source, and you can file bugs and
    submit patches. You can get started with a [good first bug] or view all
    open issues for AMO's [server] and [frontend] on Github.

  If you want to contribute but are not quite as technical, there are still
  ways to help:

  * Participate in our [forum].
  * Leave feedback for your favorite add-ons. Add-on authors are more likely
    to improve their add-ons and create new ones when they know people
    appreciate their work.
  * Tell your friends and family that Firefox is a fast, secure browser that
    protects their privacy, and they can use add-ons to make it their own!
