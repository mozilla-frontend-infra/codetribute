  ## About Data @ Mozilla

  The Data group's vision is a sustainable, global and independent Mozilla that ethically leverages data for the common good.
  Data @ Mozilla is composed of two sister teams:

  * Data Engineering: Works on the data platform that allows us to gather and analyze data about our products. This includes
    the [Glean SDK](https://mozilla.github.io/glean) as well as 
    [our data ingestion pipeline](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/pipeline/gcp_data_pipeline.html).
  * Data Science: Helps the rest of Mozilla make data informed decisions using the data platform, applying a broad range of
    statistical and analytical skills.

  A good starting point for learning more is our [team wiki page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Data).

  ## How Do I Get Started?

  If you are working on a bug (in Bugzilla), you may need to [create a new account](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/createaccount.cgi).
  If you are working on an issue (in Github), you will need a Github account.

  Comment in the bug or issue to say that you are working on it, and ask any questions that you have at that time.
  But do your research!
  Look the other comments, look at the documentation and source code, and try to figure out as much as you can first.
  This helps you learn more about the data platform and understand better the bug you're fixing or feature you're adding.

  ## How Do I Get Help?

  The best place to talk about a bug or issue is in the comments.
  Don't be afraid to ask questions or describe how you are solving the problem.
  That way, anyone watching the bug can answer your questions or offer useful advice.

  Individual data projects may have project-specific channels or forums for asking questions and getting advice.
  We are also available on [matrix.io](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#telemetry:mozilla.org) in the `#telemetry` channel in the mozilla.org community.
