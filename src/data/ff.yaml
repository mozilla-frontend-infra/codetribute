  ## About Firefox Desktop Frontend

  The Firefox Desktop has many parts. The frontend team looks after the components that drive the user interface, as well as the interface itself.

  ## How Do I Get Started?

  See our [Contributor's Quick Reference guide](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/contribution_quickref.html) for how to get the source code and start developing.

  ## How Do I Get Help?

  The best place to talk about a bug or issue is in the comments.
  Don't be afraid to ask questions or describe how you are solving the problem.
  That way, anyone watching the bug can answer your questions or offer useful advice.
  Each bug has a mentor, and that person will usually be the one to reply.

  There is also help available on [Matrix](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix) in the `#introduction:mozilla.org` channel.
  That's a great place to get quick help or work through issues with Mercurial or git as well.
