  ## About Firefox Focus

  Firefox Focus is a privacy-focused browser from Mozilla, available for the Apple iPhone, iPad, iPod touch mobile devices and Android smartphones and tablets.

  ## How Do I Get Started?

  You will need a Github account. Comment in the bug or issue to say that you are working on it, and ask any questions
  that you have at that time. But do your research!
  Look the other comments, look at the documentation and source code, and try to figure out as much as you can first.
  This helps you learn more about Focus and understand better the bug you're fixing or feature you're adding.

  ### How Do I Write the Code?

  - Start by looking for issues marked with the `good first issue` label
  - You can find more challenging issues marked with the `help wanted` label
  - Join the `#focus-android:mozilla.org` or `#focus-ios:mozilla.org` channels on [Matrix](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix) and get in contact with us. We're available Monday-Friday, during GMT and PST working hours.
  - Comment on the issue if you would like to work on it.
  - If you want to work on a new feature then always file an issue first so that all teams (product, ux, engineering) can comment on it and so that it can be assigned to a milestone. Pull requests for unsolicited features are unlikely to get merged.
  - When you open a pull request, please also include a screenshot if there are UI changes, so UX can also do a visual review.
  - Include a `Closes #<issue-number>` as part of your first commit message so it's auto-linked to the issue.

  ## How Do I Get Help?

  The best place to talk about an issue is in the comments.
  Don't be afraid to ask questions or describe how you are solving the problem.
  That way, anyone watching the bug can answer your questions or offer useful advice.
  Each issue has a mentor, and that person will usually be the one to reply.

  We are also available in the the `#focus-android:mozilla.org` or `#focus-ios:mozilla.org` channels on [Matrix](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix).
  That's a great place to get quick help or work through issues with Git, Swift, or Java.
