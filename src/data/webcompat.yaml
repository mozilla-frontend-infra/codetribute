  What is Web Compatibility?

  Web compatibility is about making sure web sites work the same way across all
  browsers and devices.

  Sometimes sites have bugs or policies that prevent them from working well in
  every browser. Sometimes browser vendors have implemented features in different
  ways. We work to help web developers and site owners identify and fix such
  issues, or raise the issues to browser vendors or standards bodies to be fixed.
